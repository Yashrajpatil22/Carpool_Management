# overview

The Carpool Management System is a smart ride-sharing platform designed for employees and daily commuters.
Users can register as drivers or passengers, view available carpools on a map, request rides, accept or reject requests, and dynamically update travel routes when passengers are picked up.

The main goal is to reduce traffic congestion, save travel costs, and provide an efficient and eco-friendly commuting solution.

# Problem we are solving

Most people commute daily to offices using their own vehicles, leading to:

    High fuel expenses

    Traffic congestion

    Increased pollution

    Underutilized seats in cars

No easy way to find people commuting on the same route

There is no simple platform where people from the same locality and same office timing can safely share rides.

# Key features

1. Smart Ride Discovery
2. Daily Office Commute Automation
3. Ride Offering for Drivers
4. Passenger Ride Requests
5. Driver Controls (Accept / Reject Requests)
